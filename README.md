# WarnPlugin

**WarnPlugin** is a plugin for [IW4MAdmin](https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin) that adds a "Warn" button to player profiles on the webfront. This plugin was originally created for **HGMServers**, but is open-source and available for anyone to use or modify.  It allows server staff to issue in-game warnings using the `!warn` command, with support for both custom and preset reasons.
